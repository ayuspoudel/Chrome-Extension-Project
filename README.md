# Dark Mode Toggle

## Overview

This project provides a JavaScript function for implementing a dark mode theme on a webpage. It enhances user experience by offering a visually appealing dark theme that reduces eye strain, especially in low-light conditions.

## Features

- **Dark Mode Styling:** Transforms the webpage's background and text colors to a dark mode theme.
- **Media Handling:** Ensures that images, videos, and other media elements are not affected by color inversions, maintaining their original appearance.

## How It Works

The function:
1. Applies a dark background and light text colors across the entire page.
2. Styles all page elements, excluding media elements such as images and videos, to prevent unwanted color distortions.
3. Resets any filters on media elements to ensure they display correctly.

## Usage

1. **Include the Script:** Integrate the provided JavaScript code into your webpage, either directly in a `<script>` tag or via an external JavaScript file.
2. **Execute the Function:** Ensure the function is executed after the page has fully loaded to apply the dark mode styles effectively.
